Binary Tree Puzzle
==================

This is an interesting puzzle I recently completed.  I came up with a few different ways to solve the third element of the puzzle, solution 4 (using a stack) being the best.

The puzzle
----------

* In your language of choice, represent nodes in a Binary tree

* Print out the contents of a binary tree

* Print out the contents of a binary tree, each depth at a time
